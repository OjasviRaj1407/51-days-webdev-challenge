# INTRODUCTION TO WEB DEVELOPMENT



--> IP-Internet Protocol (temporary address when internet is switched on)

--> IP address is provided by ISP (Internet Service Provider)

--> IP is dynamic, a different IP can be assigned each time you switch on the internet

--> DNS (Domain Name System) : maintains a dictionary-like record which has IP’s of different websites → converts domain name to IP address

--> System (google.com) → Recursive Server (DNS Resolver) → Root Server (13 in the world; .com, .in, .edu) → TLD (Top-Level Domain; list of all .com) Server → Authoritative Server

--> MAC (Medium Access Control) Address : physical address of the device (permanently attached) → (48-bit number, hexadecimal bit) → In how many ways data from your device can be transferred to another device

--> S.IP → S.MAC → Chat → R.IP → R.MAC

--> Port Number (desired tab of the browser) (16-bit unsigned)

--> S.IP → S.MAC → S.Port → Reel → R.IP → R.MAC → R.Port

--> IPv4 : 32 bit → 12.34.9.8 (example) → Range : 0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 (since smallest 8-bit number is 00000000 → 0 and largest 8-bit number is 11111111 → 255)

--> Total 2^32 IP addresses can be allocated

--> IPv6 : 128-bit (2^128 IP addresses)

--> Devices → Switch → Router

--> Public IP → Unique in Global (eg : IP of Router)

--> Private IP → Unique in Local

--> Web development → Front‑end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) + Back‑end (Node.js + Express or Spring Boot) + Database (MongoDB) → Full‑Stack Development.
